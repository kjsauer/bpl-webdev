# bpl-webdev
Web development class taught by Alex Rivadeneira (alexrivadeneira on GitHub) at Berkeley Public Library BPL

## Definitions
In this case, "web development" means programming (coding) basic websites, i.e., the front-end, which is what the user directly interacts with via the Graphical User Interface GUI, as opposed to the back-end SQL database which holds the data that is entered by the user via the GUI.

## Helpful Note
You can download and open the .html files in your web browser, or you can download and open them in Sublime Text editor (open HTML file in Sublime, right click anywhere, and select "Open in Browser"). The latter is my preferred method.
