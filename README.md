# bpl-webdev
Web development (coding aka programming) class taught by Alex Rivadeneira (alexrivadeneira on GitHub) at Berkeley Public Library BPL. You can download and open the .html files in your web browser, or you can download and open them in Sublime Text editor (open HTML file in Sublime, right click anywhere, and select "Open in Browser"). The latter is my preferred method.
